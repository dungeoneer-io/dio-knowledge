Project Zephyr is a winner.

What comes after I have no clue. Throwing out a lot of ideas that I don't care for.

What might work is to focus on things like Zephyr that are 100%. Recognize riffing ideas and don't give them much thought. They need to be expelled.

RIFF: Come up with experiments when you think of them for rainy days. Ex: Write 500 character objs in the best partition key i can think of and put them in dynamodb. Do 1000x API calls to get each and measure speed of render for each character. How much did that cost? Putting it in the db, calling it from the db, etc?

RIFF: Outside of zephyr, gather and stash will only be for "this week in progress". previous weeks won't have new data.
that'll just be the most static cachiest data-already-ready stuff. Consider: that data in its final cruncy form probably isn't the data that was "in progress" and just stopped. it'll be a more iron clad process. if you lost and needed to regenerate that data, you wouldn't just "in progress" and lift. would you?


RIFF: Set up the teams. Each team should have robot accounts/access. Put on a team's cap so you can work from the team perspective then move on.

QUEST: Do a full pipe cycle on an endpoint. Manually deploy it,pipeline deploy it. Then terraform it.
